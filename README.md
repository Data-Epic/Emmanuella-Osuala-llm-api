## How to run Customer Assistant ##

Run the following command in your terminal:
```
python assistant.py
```
Then start chatting by typing your queries. Type exit, quit, or bye to end the session.

## Example Usage ##
You: I want to return a faulty product.
Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that! Please provide your order ID so I can assist you with the return process.

You: What are your store hours?
Assistant: Our store is open Monday to Saturday, from 9 AM to 6 PM. Let me know if you need help with anything else.

## Current Limitations: ##

- The assistant does not remember previous interactions.

- Interaction with assistant is purely command-line based.

-  Basic logging and error handling only.

## Ideas for Future Enhancements: ##

- Add context-awareness and session memory.

- Build a web-based or mobile-friendly interface.

-  Connect to a real database or ticketing system (e.g., for tracking complaints).

- Add unit tests for better code coverage and stability.
